interfly: Oh, hey there, friends! Did you find anything unusual around here?
[signal arg="vclip_lv3_02"]
interfly: No? That's okay. Because I recently stumbled upon Pop-Out Pete's conversation.
[signal arg="vclip_lv3_03"]
[signal arg="flippedoff"]
interfly: He's talking now! Take a listen.
(Both of you and Interfly take a listen on what's going on at the other side. Here, you can hear Pop Out Pete talking to one of his workers about the Userbeam Converter.)
[signal arg="pete_vc01"]
pop_out_pete: So. How's the Userbeam Convertion going so far?
[signal arg="pete_vc02"]
"Worker Userbeam": Well, about that boss. We have some little bit of situation.
[signal arg="pete_vc03"]
pop_out_pete: What?! What's going on?
[signal arg="pete_vc04"]
"Worker Userbeam": It appears, sir, that we have an Intruder (or some Intruders) on our mits at the Dark Web.
[signal arg="pete_vc05"]
"Worker Userbeam": They're swiping each Userbeams out left and right.
[signal arg="pete_vc06"]
pop_out_pete: Graah!!! So this is Interfly doing! That no good bug. I guess I have to deal with it my own.
[signal arg="pete_vc07"]
"Worker Userbeam": You're going up there?
[signal arg="pete_vc08"]
pop_out_pete: Yup. And don't worry, I'll be waiting for that bug, and his swampy little twerps from there.
[signal arg="pete_vc09"]
"Worker Userbeam": Okay boss. Good luck!
[signal arg="pete_vc10"]
pop_out_pete: Time to give them a "pop-up" surprise. Mwhahahaha!
[signal arg="vclip_lv3_04"]
[signal arg="flippedon"]
interfly: Uh oh! It seems that he know we're here.
[signal arg="vclip_lv3_05"]
interfly: Well, I guess we have no other choice but to fight him head-on.
[signal arg="vclip_lv3_06"]
interfly: I'll go and get the mailbox set up. At the same time, you climb up there and meet up with Pop-Out Pete. I'll catch up from there.
[signal arg="vclip_lv3_07"]
interfly: Let's do it, friends. THIS IS IT!!
