friend: Okay. So we got this here.
[signal arg="talking"]
[signal arg="flippedoff"]
friend: Now for me, I can easily go in without any effort.
[signal arg="pointing"]
friend: But for a size like yourself however, there are some effort to put in.
[signal arg="welcome"]
friend: For gaps like these, this is the part where you use your crouching move.
[signal arg="talking"]
friend: Likewise with moving around with the Left and Right arrow keys, hold down the Down arrow key to well... sit down.
[signal arg="normaltalk"]
friend: You can also perform this with a controller by moving your joystick down (if you have set it up on the keybinding).
[signal arg="talking"]
friend: While you're sitting, then use the left and right again to crouch. It's useful to fit in small places like this one here.
[signal arg="talking"]
friend: You can always let go of the down arrow key to stop crouching. (Though you can't do that while you're underneath a tight area. You have to wait until there's room for you to stand.)
[signal arg="pointing"]
friend: Oh yeah, One more thing that I forgot to tell you at the beginning.
[signal arg="welcome"]
friend: With the whole moving thing, you can also hold down the Shift key to move/crouch faster. It's just for those who doesn't have time, and want to get head on.
[signal arg="talking"]
friend: Though, don't be too much of a rushy pickle. Only use it when it's necessary.
[signal arg="greatest"]
friend: Right. So, go ahead and crouch through this gap.
