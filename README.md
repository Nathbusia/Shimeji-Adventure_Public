# Shimeji Adventure - Official Source Code

Welcome to the source code of Shimeji Adventure. This source code is here for people who wants to mkae mods for the game. Such as Custom Characters, Custom Levels, Custom Bosses, and so on.

Keep in mind not to claim the source code and the game itself as yours. Because you know, that's just a donkey move.
But yeah, check around, or download the source code, and have fun modding!

## What is Shimeji Adventure?

Shimeji Adventure is a 2D Platformer fan game based on and starring the Shimeji Desktop Pets by Yuki Yamada of Group Finity. Shimeji Adventure (as its name suggests) is where you get to play as the Shimeji themselves (or any other characters if you mod them in).

You can go through up to 6 levels (2 of which are only available in Freeplay Mode), and even go through a short Story Mode (though it'll get longer as the game's update goes by).

 This game is still in its Demo State, and there will be updates as time passes. So stay tuned where there's more news and updates for this game.

## Requirements

* You'll need Godot Engine 4.4.1 + to load the game's project file.

## Mods Guidance

The Mods guidance can be found on the ModdingGuidePDF folder in this source code.
There will be videos version for them too later in the future.

But for now at this time, there's only Character Modding Guide. The Levels and Bosses Modding Guide will be around in a few days after the release of the game.
